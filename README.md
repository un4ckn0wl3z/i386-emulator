## Key features:

- Implements core real-mode instructions (partial instruction set)
- 32-bit environment
- Supports register operations, memory addressing, and flag updates
- Provides detailed instruction execution flow and cycle-accurate emulation logic
- Omits I/O and peripheral device emulation to maintain clarity and focus on CPU internals

## Ideal for:
- Learning how x86 instructions are decoded and executed
- Exploring CPU design and low-level system behavior
- Building a foundation for a full protected-mode or hardware emulator
